--Project Overview--

This is the final project in the TOP Foundations course--creating a working on-screen calculator! I've learned a lot about how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in tandem to create stylish, interactive webpages. This is an opportunity to make use of all that I've learned up to this point to create a somewhat-complex project. Of course, I'm going to do my best to add other features and bring my own practical ideas to life so that I can say I've made something uniquely my own!

However, this is ONLY THE BEGINNING.
I will continue building my own personal projects moving forward while also delving into new languages such as Python and PostgreSQL, and I'll also try my hand at some frameworks as I raise the level of my skills.
